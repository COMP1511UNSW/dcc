logical-and-always-false.c:3:18: warning: overlapping comparisons always evaluate to false [-Wtautological-overlap-compare]
    if (argc > 1 && argc < 1)
        ~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~
dcc explanation: Your '&&' expression is always false, no matter what value variables have.
Perhaps you meant to use '||' ?
