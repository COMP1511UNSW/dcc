tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/logical-and-always-false.c:3:15: warning: overlapping comparisons always evaluate to false [-Wtautological-overlap-compare]
        if (argc > 1 && argc < 1)
            ~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~
dcc explanation: Your '&&' expression is always false, no matter what value variables have.
Perhaps you meant to use '||' ?
