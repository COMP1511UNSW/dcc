tests/run_time_errors/call_stack_uninitialized.c:4:9: runtime error - accessing a value via a uninitialized pointer

dcc explanation: You are using a pointer which has not been initialized
  A common error is accessing *p without first assigning a value to p.

Execution stopped in f3(a=<uninitialized value>) in tests/run_time_errors/call_stack_uninitialized.c at line 4:

int f3(int *a) {
-->	return *a;
}

Values when execution stopped:

a = <uninitialized value>
