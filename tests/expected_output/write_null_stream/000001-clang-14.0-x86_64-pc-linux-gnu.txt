tests/run_time_errors/write_null_stream.c: In function ‘main’:
tests/run_time_errors/write_null_stream.c:4:9: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]
    4 |         fprintf(NULL, "Hello world\n");
      |         ^~~~~~~
dcc explanation: you are passing a NULL value as argument 1 to 'fprintf'.
Argument 1 to 'fprintf' should never be NULL.
