tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/implicit_function_declaration.c:2:5: warning: implicit declaration of function 'f' is invalid in C99 [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    f();
    ^
dcc explanation: you are calling a function named f line 2 of tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/implicit_function_declaration.c but dcc does not recognize f as a function.
There are several possible causes:
  a) You might have misspelt the function name.
  b) You might need to add a #include line at the top of tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/implicit_function_declaration.c.
  c) You might need to add a prototype for f.
