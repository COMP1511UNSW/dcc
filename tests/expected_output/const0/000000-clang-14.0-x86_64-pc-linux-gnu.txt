Runtime error: division by zero
dcc explanation: A common error is to evaluate x / y when y == 0 which is undefined.

Execution stopped in main() in const0.c at line 9:

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int i = 0;
    const int j = 2;
    if (argc == 0) {
        i = 1;
    }
--> printf("%d\n", j / i);
}

Values when execution stopped:

argc = 1
i = 0
j = 2
