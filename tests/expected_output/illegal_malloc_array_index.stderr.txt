illegal_malloc_array_index.c:5 runtime error - illegal array, pointer or other operation [heap buffer overflow]
Attempted to access past the end of allocated memory. Make sure you have allocated enough memory for the size of your struct/array (rather than size of a pointer).
Execution stopped here in main() in illegal_malloc_array_index.c at line 5:

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	int *a = malloc(1000 * sizeof (int));
-->	a[999 + argc] = 42;
}

Values when execution stopped:

argc =  <deleted-value>
999 + argc = 1000
a[999 + argc] =  <deleted-value>
