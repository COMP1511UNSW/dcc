Runtime error: accessing a field via an uninitialized pointer
dcc explanation: You are using a pointer which has not been initialized
  A common error is using p->field without first assigning a value to p.

Execution stopped in main() in dereference_uninitialized_with_arrow_arrow_arrow.c at line 10:

int main(void) {
    struct list_node *a = (struct list_node *)malloc(sizeof *a);
    a->next = (struct list_node *)malloc(sizeof *a);
--> a->next->next->data = 42;
}

Values when execution stopped:

a->next->next = <uninitialized value>
