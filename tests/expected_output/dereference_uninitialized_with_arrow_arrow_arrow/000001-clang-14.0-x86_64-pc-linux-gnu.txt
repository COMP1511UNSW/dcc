dcc explanation:You are using a pointer which has not been initialized
  A common error is using p->field without first assigning a value to p.

Execution stopped in main() in tests/run_time_errors/dereference_uninitialized_with_arrow_arrow_arrow.c at line 10:

int main(void) { 
    struct list_node *a = (struct list_node *)malloc(sizeof *a);
    a->next =  (struct list_node *)malloc(sizeof *a);
--> a->next->next->data = 42;
}

Values when execution stopped:

a->next->next = <uninitialized value>
