multiple_unsequenced_modifications.c:2:16: warning: multiple unsequenced modifications to 'argc' [-Wunsequenced]
    argc = argc--;
         ~     ^
dcc explanation: you are changing a variable multiple times in the one statement. 
`++` and `--` change the variable, there is no need to also assign the result to the variable.
