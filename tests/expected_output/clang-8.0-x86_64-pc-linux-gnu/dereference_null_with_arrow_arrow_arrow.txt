tests/run_time_errors/dereference_null_with_arrow_arrow_arrow.c:10:20: runtime error - accessing a field via a NULL pointer

dcc explanation: You are using a pointer which is NULL
  A common error is  using p->field when p == NULL.

Execution stopped here in main() in tests/run_time_errors/dereference_null_with_arrow_arrow_arrow.c at line 10:

    struct list_node *a = &s1;
    s1.next = &s2;
--> a->next->next->data = 42;
}

Values when execution stopped:

s1 = {next = 0x<deleted-hexadecimal-constant>, data =  <deleted-value>
s2 = {next = NULL, data =  <deleted-value>
a->next->next =  <deleted-value>
