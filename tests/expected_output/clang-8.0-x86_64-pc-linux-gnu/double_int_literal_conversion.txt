tests/extracted_compile_time_tests/double_int_literal_conversion.c:3:10: warning: implicit conversion from 'double' to 'int' changes value from 6.7 to 6 [-Wliteral-conversion]
        int i = 6.7;
            ~   ^~~
dcc explanation: you are assigning the floating point number 6.7 to the int variable i , if this is what you want, change 6.7 to 6
