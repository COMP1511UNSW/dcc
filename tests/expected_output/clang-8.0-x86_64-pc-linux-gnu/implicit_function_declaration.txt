dcc explanation: you are calling a function named f line 3 of tests/extracted_compile_time_tests/implicit_function_declaration.c but dcc does not recognize f as a function.
There are several possible causes:
  a) You might have misspelt the function name.
  b) You might need to add a #include line at the top of tests/extracted_compile_time_tests/implicit_function_declaration.c.
  c) You might need to add a prototype for f.
