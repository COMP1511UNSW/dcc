tests/run_time_errors/illegal_malloc_array_index.c:9 runtime error - malloc buffer overflow

dcc explanation: access past the end of malloc'ed memory.
  Make sure you have allocated enough memory for the size of your struct/array.
  A common error is to use the size of a pointer instead of the size of the struct or array.

Execution stopped in main() in tests/run_time_errors/illegal_malloc_array_index.c at line 9:

int main(int argc, char **argv) { 
	int *a = (int *)malloc(1000 * sizeof (int));
-->	a[999 + argc] = 42;
	return 0;
}

Values when execution stopped:

argc = 1
999 + argc = 1000
a[999 + argc] = 0
