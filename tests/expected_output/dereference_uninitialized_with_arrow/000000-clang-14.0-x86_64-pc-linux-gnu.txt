Runtime error: accessing a field via an uninitialized pointer
dcc explanation: You are using a pointer which has not been initialized
  A common error is using p->field without first assigning a value to p.

Execution stopped in main() in dereference_uninitialized_with_arrow.c at line 12:

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    struct list_node *a = (struct list_node *)malloc(2 * sizeof *a);
    if (argc != 1) {
        a->next = NULL;
    }
--> a->next->data = 42;
}

Values when execution stopped:

argc = 1
a->next = <uninitialized value>
