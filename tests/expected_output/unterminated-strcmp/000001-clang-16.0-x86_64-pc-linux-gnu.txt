  Make sure your array indices are correct.
Execution stopped in main() in unterminated-strcmp.c at line 8:

int main(void) {
    char i[2];
    char j[2];
    i[0] = 'H';
    j[0] = 'H';
--> return strcmp(i, j);
}

Values when execution stopped:

i = "H<uninitialized value>"
j = "H<uninitialized value>"
i[0] = 72 = 'H'
j[0] = 72 = 'H'
