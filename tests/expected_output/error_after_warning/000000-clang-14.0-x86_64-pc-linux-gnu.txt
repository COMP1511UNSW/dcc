    if (a = b) {
        ~~^~~
error_after_warning.c:4:11: note: place parentheses around the assignment to silence this warning
    if (a = b) {
          ^
        (    )
error_after_warning.c:4:11: note: use '==' to turn this assignment into an equality comparison
    if (a = b) {
          ^
          ==[0m
dcc explanation: you use '=' to assign to a variable, you use '==' to compare values.
error_after_warning.c:7:9: error: use of undeclared identifier 'c'
    a = c;
        ^
dcc explanation:  you have used the name 'c' on line 7 of error_after_warning.c without previously declaring it.
If you meant to use 'c' as a variable, check you have declared it by specifying its type
Also  check you have spelled 'c' correctly everywhere.
