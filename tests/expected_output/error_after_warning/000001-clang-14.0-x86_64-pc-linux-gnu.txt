dcc explanation: you use '=' to assign to a variable, you use '==' to compare values.
tests/compile_time_errors/error_after_warning.c:8:7: error: use of undeclared identifier 'c'
  a = c;
      ^
dcc explanation:  you have used the name 'c' on line 8 of tests/compile_time_errors/error_after_warning.c without previously declaring it.
If you meant to use 'c' as a variable, check you have declared it by specifying its type
Also  check you have spelled 'c' correctly everywhere.
