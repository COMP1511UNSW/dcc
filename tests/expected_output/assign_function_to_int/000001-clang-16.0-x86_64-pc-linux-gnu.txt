assign_function_to_int.c:2:9: error: incompatible pointer to integer conversion initializing 'int' with an expression of type 'int (int, char **)' [-Wint-conversion]
    int a = main;
        ^   ~~~~
dcc explanation: you are attempting to assign main which is a function to an int variable.
Perhaps you are trying to call the function and have forgotten the round brackets and any parameter values.
