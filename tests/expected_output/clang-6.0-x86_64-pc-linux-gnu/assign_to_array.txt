tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/assign_to_array.c:4:4: error: array type 'int [1]' is not assignable
        a = b;
        ~ ^
dcc explanation: you are trying to assign to 'a' which is an array with 1 element.
  You can not assign to a whole array.
  You can use a loop to assign to each array element individually.
