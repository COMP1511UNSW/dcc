tests/compile_time/variable_used_in_own_initialization.c:2:10: warning: variable 'x' is uninitialized when used within its own initialization [-Wuninitialized]
        int x = x + 1;
            ~   ^
dcc explanation: Looks like you have `x` on both the left- and right-hand side of the `=` on line 2 of `tests/compile_time/variable_used_in_own_initialization.c`, but `x` doesn't yet have a value.
 Be sure not to initialize `x` with itself.
