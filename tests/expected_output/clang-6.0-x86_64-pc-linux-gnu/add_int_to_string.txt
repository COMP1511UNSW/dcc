dcc explanation: Careful, you can't concatenate values and strings in C using the `+` operator, as you seem to be trying to do on line 4 of `tests/compile_time_errors/add_int_to_string.c`.
 Odds are you want to provide `printf` with a format code for that value and pass that value to `printf` as an argument.
