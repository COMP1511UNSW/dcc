tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/missing_library_include.c:3:2: warning: implicitly declaring library function 'printf' with type 'int (const char *, ...)' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
        printf("hello");
        ^
dcc explanation: You are calling the function printf on line 3 of tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/missing_library_include.c but dcc does not recognize printf as a function
because you have forgotten to #include <stdio.h>
