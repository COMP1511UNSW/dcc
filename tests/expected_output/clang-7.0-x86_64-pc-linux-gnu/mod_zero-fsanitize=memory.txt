Execution stopped by an arithmetic error.
Often this is caused by division (or %) by zero.
Execution stopped here in main() in tests/run_time_errors/mod_zero.c at line 7:

#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) { 
-->	printf("%d\n", 42 % (argc - 1));
}

Values when execution stopped:

argc =  <deleted-value>
