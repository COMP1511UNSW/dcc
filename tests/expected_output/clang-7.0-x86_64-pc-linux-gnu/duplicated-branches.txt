tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/duplicated-branches.c: In function ‘main’:
tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/duplicated-branches.c:3:5: warning: this condition has identical branches [-Wduplicated-branches]
  if (argc == 1)
     ^
dcc explanation: Your if statement has identical then and else parts.
It is pointless to have an if statement which executes the same code
when its condition is true and also when its condition is false.
