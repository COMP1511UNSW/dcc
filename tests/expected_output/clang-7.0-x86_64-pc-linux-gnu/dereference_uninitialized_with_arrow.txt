tests/run_time/dereference_uninitialized_with_arrow.c:9:14: runtime error - accessing a field via an uninitialized pointer

dcc explanation: You are using a pointer which has not been initialized
  A common error is using p->field without first assigning a value to p.

Execution stopped here in main() in tests/run_time/dereference_uninitialized_with_arrow.c at line 9:

int main(void) { 
    struct list_node *a = malloc(sizeof *a);
--> a->next->data = 42;
}
