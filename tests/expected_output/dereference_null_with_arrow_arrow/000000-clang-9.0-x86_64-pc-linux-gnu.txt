tests/run_time_errors/dereference_null_with_arrow_arrow.c:9:14: runtime error - accessing a field via a NULL pointer

dcc explanation: You are using a pointer which is NULL
  A common error is  using p->field when p == NULL.

Execution stopped in main() in tests/run_time_errors/dereference_null_with_arrow_arrow.c at line 9:

int main(void) { 
    struct list_node s = {0};
    struct list_node *a = &s;
--> a->next->next->data = 42;
}

Values when execution stopped:

s = {next = NULL, data = 0}
a->next = NULL
