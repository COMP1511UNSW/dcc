tests/run_time_errors/int_overflow.c:5:6: runtime error - signed integer overflow: <deleted-large-integer-constant> + 1 cannot be represented in type 'int'

dcc explanation: There are limits in the range of values that can be represented in all types.
  Your program has produced a value outside that range.

Execution stopped in main() in tests/run_time_errors/int_overflow.c at line 5:

int main(int argc, char **argv) { 
	int k = INT_MAX;
-->	k += argc;
}

Values when execution stopped:

argc =  <deleted-value>
k =  <deleted-value>
