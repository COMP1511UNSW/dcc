Runtime error: accessing a field via a NULL pointer
dcc explanation: You are using a pointer which is NULL
  A common error is  using p->field when p == NULL.

Execution stopped in main() in example2.c at line 13:

int main(void) {
    struct node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    new_node->next = NULL;
    struct node *current = new_node->next;
--> printf("%d\n", current->value);
    return 0;
}

Values when execution stopped:

current = NULL
new_node->next = NULL
