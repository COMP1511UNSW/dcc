EXPLANATION: Looks like you're trying to access an element of the array `a` on line 3 of `tests/compile_time/array_string_index.c`, but your index (`"0"`) is not of type `int`.
 Right now, your index is of type `string` instead.
 Make sure your index (the value between square brackets) is an `int`.
