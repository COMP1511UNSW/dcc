tests/extracted_compile_time_errors/stack_use_after_return.c:3:13: warning: address of stack memory associated with local variable 'i' returned [-Wreturn-stack-address]
    return &i;
            ^
dcc explanation: you are trying to return a pointer to the local variable 'i'.
You can not do this because i will not exist after the function returns.
