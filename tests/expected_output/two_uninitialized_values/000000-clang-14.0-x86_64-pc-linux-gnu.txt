tests/run_time_errors/two_uninitialized_values.c:4:17 runtime error - signed integer overflow: -1094795586 + -1094795586 cannot be represented in type 'int'
dcc explanation:Your program looks to be using an uninitialized value.
  -1094795586 is probably actually an uninitialized value.

Execution stopped in main() in tests/run_time_errors/two_uninitialized_values.c at line 4:

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int a[2];
    a[argc] = 1;
--> return a[0] + a[0];
}

Values when execution stopped:

a = {<uninitialized value>, 1}
argc = 1
a[argc] = 1
